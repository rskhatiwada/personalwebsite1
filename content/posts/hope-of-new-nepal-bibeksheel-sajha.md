It is apparent that the Nepalese political sphere has become quite chaotic and climactic lately. Political instability and a lack of good governance to manage situations have almost become a norm, negatively affecting the national development agenda for a long time. Putting aside national development and observing the sudden flux of political consensus among the people, it is evident that the political sphere of contemporary Nepal is about to change.

A number of unexpected turns can be seen in society, particularly in people's affairs. The vision of a perfect leader and responsible, rational citizens vehemently yearning for change can now be directly witnessed after a long time, unlike the tales of a utopian past or future accessible only through imagination.

Yes, you guessed correctly. I am talking about none other than **Bibeksheel Sajha** and its political inspiration and prowess.

Whether you believe in the aspiration of Bibeksheel Sajha or not, one thing is certain: Bibeksheel Sajha is inspired by a cause—social reform and economic prosperity. It is clear that Bibeksheels are not typical political cadres, and they wouldn't make political rants and speeches without genuine hope among Nepalis for a better future.

Giants like **Nepali Congress (NC), communist forces like United Marxist-Leninist (UML), and Maoists** are heroes of political leadership in Nepal. Their roles in creating political awareness and protecting civil rights can't simply be dismissed (I won't discuss their shortcomings, as it doesn't fit this article's rationale).

However, when considering politics and the prospect of serving the nation, it is important to consider the need of the time. Responsible citizens must constantly readjust themselves to facilitate these needs. Politics isn't a field where past credentials should be judged against present flaws. These classical parties championed democracy, monarchy abolition, secularism, mixed proportional representation, social inclusion, federalism, republicanism, and human rights protection (excluding violations), and the list goes on. Thanks to their ambitious political goals, we have achieved considerable political consensus. However, in pursuing supreme power, these champions created extreme political aspirations inappropriate for a small, peaceful country like Nepal. Extreme ideology is worse than no ideology. Clearly, we no longer subscribe to such ideological pursuits, having seen enough of the idea of a final solution. All we need now is good governance driving economic prosperity, social reform, and peace.

These giants can no longer fulfill the needs of our time. Their primary goals have been achieved—a liberal constitution, an inclusive sovereign constitutional assembly for amendments, an able judiciary, a strong, flexible military, and politically literate citizens. There's nothing left for these parties to achieve. Thanks to their constant effort, they deserve honor from Nepalis.

After a prolonged period of contemplation and dissatisfaction, Nepalis finally recognize the current need clearly. Now is the time for real progress—improvement in infrastructure, lifestyle, quality of life, education, healthcare, leadership practices, accountability, and political honesty. Our exhausted political leaders haven't yet grasped these new demands. We need experts and politically inspired leaders of change. Most importantly, we need people who love their country. This is the most necessary requirement; the rest is optional.

This is exactly where Bibeksheel Sajha fits.

Officially, I am not a Bibeksheel Sajha member, but I supported their election campaigns during Kathmandu metropolitan city's local-level election. Despite personal reasons for avoiding politics or voluntary membership in any organization, I couldn’t hesitate to support them. I don’t believe I need to justify my love for my country.

I was astounded by their honesty. They never compromised their standard of political decency, prompting me to question my morality. If you haven't met them yet, please do. Certain things seem exaggerated only until personally experienced.

Now, let's discuss **Rabindra Mishra.** I don't claim Rabindra Mishra will bring radical change, but he certainly symbolizes hope for improvement. His greatest credential is not being a professional political player. He's inspired to enact change and represents one of us, which matters most. Although people become scrutinized under the spotlight, the public's judgment of him and his political emergence is significant. Astounding public support for his election campaigns and acceptance of Bibeksheel Sajha indicate people’s deep longing for change. Journalism is constructively contributing here, rather than engaging in the usual tit-for-tat exchanges. The Bibeksheel Sajha movement has captured national attention, already unsettling major political players and status quo advocates. It isn't an exaggeration to say that anyone who loves their country supports this movement, at least intellectually.

Many might think Bibeksheel Sajha has aspirations without concrete promises. The culture of making grand promises during election campaigns and blatantly breaking them later persists in Nepalese politics. Bibeksheel Sajha seeks to change that. They hope for public support so all "country lovers" can collectively act. They don’t necessarily need a separate manifesto, although they do have clear agendas for national prosperity and reform.

**Bibeksheel Sajha** differs from contemporary political parties. We must readjust ourselves to accommodate their political aspirations. By constantly expecting exaggerated promises (like making Nepal another Singapore or introducing a monorail within three years) and applauding them blindly, we have previously destroyed Nepal’s political future. We encouraged our political leaders—once patriotic freedom fighters—to give populist answers rather than achieve genuine economic and social reforms. It isn't just our country’s governance that needs change.

The prowess of a political leader doesn't lie merely in delivering powerful speeches like Prachanda. Let's be fair—what else could that helpless creature do? He's just trying to survive.

Let’s not force Bibeksheel Sajha into that trap. Let's embrace and build upon it ourselves. Let's not squander this unique opportunity.
