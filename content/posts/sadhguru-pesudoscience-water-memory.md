## Introduction

Water is essential to life, and its properties have been well studied by science. Yet, throughout history, some have tried to ascribe mystical abilities to it—whether through religious rituals, alternative medicine, or pseudoscientific claims. One such claim is the idea that water has "memory," a notion that has been widely debunked by the scientific community but continues to resurface in spiritual and New Age circles. 

At the forefront of this modern-day myth is Sadhguru, a popular mystic and self-styled guru, who promotes the idea that water can retain information, respond to thoughts, and be energetically influenced. His claims, wrapped in scientific-sounding jargon, appeal to a wide audience eager to believe in hidden powers of nature. But do these claims hold any scientific merit, or are they just another case of **pseudoscience disguised as wisdom**? Let’s dive in.

## The Pseudoscience of "Water Memory"

Water, as we know it, is **dihydrogen oxide**—a specific combination of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom. If there’s anything extraordinary about water, it’s the ability to undergo **anomalous expansion**: unlike most substances, water **expands** when it freezes and contracts when heated between a temperature range of 0C to 4C. This makes **ice less dense than liquid water**, allowing it to float—an essential property that enables **aquatic life to survive** beneath frozen surfaces. 

Now, if you already thought of this (anamolous expansion itself) as some divine intervention—perhaps **so Lord Vishnu could relax under layers of snow in cosmic privacy**—you’re already off the boat. No hard feelings, but there’s nothing more I can offer you. If you’re still here, though, we’ve got work to do.

Like any other molecule, **water retains the same properties regardless of its source**. But enter Sadhguru—self-proclaimed mystic, entrepreneur, and master of delivering **scientific nonsense with a hypnotic voice**.

His audience? A mix of **religious fanatics** and **new-age spiritualists**, both already sold on his "wisdom" and eager to **affirm, not question, his claims**. His technique? **Inductive logic**—using broad, often misleading examples to reinforce pre-existing beliefs while sidestepping the scientific method entirely. 

He claims: _"Water traps all vibrations around itself"_—and **even urges people to check the research themselves**. So, I did. Turns out, **there isn’t any**. No solid scientific study supports this claim, except for an interesting but controversial take by **Luc Montagnier** (Nobel Prize 2008, for discovering HIV). Montagnier was inspired by an idea first introduced by biologist **Jacques Benveniste**, who proposed that water could retain the "memory" of substances previously dissolved in it—even after extreme dilution. **This idea has been debunked multiple times.**

Even if some **tiny fragment of truth exists**, it’s nowhere near the exaggerated nonsense peddled by Sadhguru. But of course, why stop at facts when you can sell spirituality instead?

## The Business of Misinterpreting Science

Sadhguru’s brand of mysticism isn’t just about grand claims—it’s about **profit**. When he says:  
_"Take a glass of water, hold it in your hand, think positive thoughts, and the water will respond accordingly."_  
he’s not just being **laughably ignorant**—he’s **a businessman selling a belief system**.

Then there’s this gem:  
_"The molecular structure of water can be rearranged without changing its chemical properties just by thought."_

Behind the image of the wise sage lies a **proponent of the Law of Attraction**, wrapping it up in pseudo-scientific packaging. And like other "manifestation" gurus, **he sells an illusion**—one that conveniently lines his pockets through books, courses, and retreats.

And let’s not pretend that **misinterpreting science is limited to mystics**. Even some of the **greatest scientific minds** have fallen into traps of personal bias:
- **Isaac Newton**, the father of classical mechanics, was **obsessed with alchemy and biblical prophecy**.
- **Linus Pauling**, the father of molecular biology, firmly believed that **vitamin C cures terminal cancer**—without solid proof.

But the key difference? **Science as a method is self-correcting.** What a scientist believes personally is irrelevant—their work must stand up to **peer review, repeatability, and empirical testing**. Mystics like Sadhguru **weaponize** science’s credibility while rejecting its methodology.

## Science or Commercialism?

The phrase _"This is scientific!"_ has become a **marketing tool**, used whenever convenient. Whenever science produces something commercially valuable, mystics are the first to **cite it without understanding it**. 

What **truly** pisses me off? A man, deemed an intelligent thinker (and in many ways, he is), **gets away with peddling nonsense** because his audience is primed to believe him. He doesn’t sell knowledge—he sells **confusion packaged as wisdom**. 

And yet, in the name of "science," he thrives.
