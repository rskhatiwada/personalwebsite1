I am aware that I am not uniquely in a position to have standard dreams; standard in the sense that they stand out among many such dreams. But let me assume myself as an idealist and, at least for a moment, take for granted that my dreams wouldn’t remain dreams forever but would manifest themselves upon the passage of time, under whatever conditions.

I have a dream that I would feel proud of myself for being born in a country of great people, and not just for being born in a great country. And I have a dream that these great people would realize their authentic greatness and elevate themselves to such a level that immorality, bigotry, or any form of violence would be regarded as mere elements of history, if that were their only abode until they were forgotten.

I have a dream that we would have a world operating truly in the order of science and rationalism, with development, the only motivation. A world whose citizens would realize how mysterious and grandiose the cosmos and our existence are, and develop a sense of planet-hood and cooperation; a truly phenomenal world whose citizens don’t assume responsibilities from memory alone but from intuition; a secular world where freedom of speech is abundant, where the conditions to enjoy one’s life and existence would be inspiring. I have a dream of a world striving to make our human race stand out at the frontiers of cosmic discoveries.

And more importantly, I have a dream that people would have genuine dreams; dreams so genuine that they would provide sufficient reason for their sense of significance, making their lives meaningful—often on a subjective basis so that they aren’t compromised by what the world thinks of them or how good they must appear.
