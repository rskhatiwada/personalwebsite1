Is it possible for something, in the name of luck, to turn out in one's favor without any immediate causal reason? Is such luck merely an after-effect of wishful thinking, influencing the outcome or interpreting it in ways favorable to the outcome?

For the sake of argument, let’s presume we know nothing about Luck. In doing so, we have an excuse to grant the benefit of doubt that it exists, and examine it as real for weighing its pros and cons.

Let me start with the story of a great, brave warrior named RAMATHRA. In various battles between the devils and Early men that lasted centuries, it is rumored that RAMATHRA was the bravest of the brave. He single-handedly destroyed several civilizations of devils. Anything that threatened Early men, RAMATHRA would stand strong to protect them. In those days of bravery, RAMATHRA was the ultimate standard. People aspired to become RAMATHRA. He was the best people could conceive of, and they often termed him lucky, for it was unlikely that someone of an ordinary past and lowly origin could have such a future of glory and fortune. His strength was the subject of research and studies, which many generations of thinkers pondered yet understood very little. How could RAMATHRA have such incredible strength despite being human and born from ordinary parents? How was it possible to have luck on one’s side like RAMATHRA did?

RAMATHRA was the best of humans, envied even by the Gods. He was simply too perfect.

After one more endless battle with the devils, he was quite exhausted, but as inferred, it wasn’t much of an issue for him. He gave a tough fight again. No devil, however strong, could come close to RAMATHRA. It was rumored that the devils once held a meeting attempting to change themselves, but without success, because there truly was no way to withstand RAMATHRA. The strength of RAMATHRA was a matter of luck for the humans. RAMATHRA’s strength was a check between good and evil, right and wrong. RAMATHRA was divine.

It was a usual day on Earth when something unfortunate happened to humans. RAMATHRA fell in love with devils, suddenly, while slaying them. It wasn't exactly sudden. RAMATHRA had been questioning his existence lately. "Am I only good for killing devils? After all, they are creations of god and thus beautiful. Who am I to kill them like smashing a toy?" he asked. Something persistent within him refused to let him give up. But ultimately, RAMATHRA was human—a helpless human. He questioned his existence, asked questions, and sought to better himself. "I must attend a university and gain some college experience. I must learn to flirt with girls, especially KUNTIKA, start a family, and have kids. I must learn to sing 'I love you,'" he thought while smashing a devil leader’s head into the nearest rock. For the first time, he felt uncomfortable seeing the blood oozing out like a smashed tomato. It was enough. RAMATHRA was done. But devils wouldn't stop attacking him. He either softened his blows or threw persistent devils into the mountains out of emotional disgust.

RAMATHRA went directly to the city council, blood all over his body, and informed the counselors of his doubts about killing devils. He had studied "FREE WILL" by Sam Harris (a distinguished author from antiquity) the previous night, realizing devils had no choice but to act foolishly, thus it wasn't moral to hold them accountable. "After all, they have no control over their actions," he said. RAMATHRA stayed calm and silent for weeks. He neither ate nor spoke nor fought unless absolutely necessary. Even when fighting became unavoidable, he was deeply uncomfortable. He fought briefly, then retreated to read books from an old buried building he discovered while urinating beside a mountain. Archaeologists concluded some 1000 years later that it was actually the Library of Congress, buried beneath Alaskan mountains following a massive earthquake that had destroyed modern human civilization.

The language developed by Early humans was in its infancy, lacking grammatical standards or sufficient literature, except for a few pages outlining their accord regarding democracy and their economic plans for the next century. There was no politically correct governance structure. What they called democracy was more a thug-like rule by self-proclaimed counselors who cared little beyond their next battle with devils. It's surprising that humans typically reach similar conclusions regardless of conditions.

RAMATHRA was summoned to the supreme court for a public hearing. Observing the sudden public outrage, it was clear this wouldn't be a good day for RAMATHRA. People were indignant upon hearing RAMATHRA’s opinions about the devils. "HERETIC RAMATHRA!", "SLAY THAT BEAST!" many yelled.

The majestic beast RAMATHRA had been was gone. He appeared old and weak, chains covering his body, guarded by an army of 1000. Anyone who remembered RAMATHRA's capabilities could imagine him easily thrashing those soldiers or plucking their heads like flowers. But RAMATHRA did nothing. He looked drugged, lost in contemplation.

Further studies introduced him to a conspiracy theory that touched him deeply. According to this theory, around 200 years earlier, devils mastered seduction and convinced themselves and their gods that they were humans. They disguised themselves as humans and raided the original humans. Devils took the son of the human leader and rewrote history, convincing everyone that humans were the devils and devils were the real humans. RAMATHRA realized the devil leader he had smashed against the rock was none other than his father. He was devastated, weeping. Everyone hated him; nobody understood his torment. Whether he was a victim of his own success or a captive of reason was for him alone to decide. Ultimately, RAMATHRA was executed. Nobody remembered the brave soldier RAMATHRA from history, except the writer of this story.

However, after about 100,000 years, a meteor hit Earth, obliterating everything. RAMATHRA, his human father, devil enemies, wars, archaeologists and their research, the writer who fueled this imagination, and even readers of this article—all eventually disappeared from existence.

Unless it's the absolute end, one cannot conclude if something is favorable. Given immediate chaos and uncertainty, outcomes remain unpredictable. And if there is an absolute end enabling conclusions, what's the point? The question of luck ceases to exist.
