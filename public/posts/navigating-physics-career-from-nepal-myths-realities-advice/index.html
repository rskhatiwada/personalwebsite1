<title>Navigating Physics Career From Nepal: Myths, Realities and Advice on applying abroad for PhD</title>

<meta property='og:description' content='&lt;h2 id=&#34;speaking-from-experience&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking from Experience&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, I want to share a bit about my background: I was accepted into a &lt;strong&gt;top 30 US PhD program in physics&lt;/strong&gt;, and I speak from &lt;strong&gt;personal experience&lt;/strong&gt;. I have always been a bright student. My GPA in MSc was 3.6 and although I took PGRE and GRE, I didn&amp;rsquo;t score stellar marks either. But I was significantly stronger when it comes to research experience. I had 3 first author publications and 2 other publications &lt;strong&gt;(some even in Q1 journals).&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that it was my research merit that got me selected. I never wanted to apply to common universities because I knew for sure that, universities without serious research mean nothing for a career in physics except for a shaky promise to be able to stay abroad. So my priority was to apply to good research universities. But your priorities might be different. and I understand and respect that. The path to a career in physics is not easy, and coming from Nepal presents its own set of challenges. However, I firmly believe that success is &lt;strong&gt;not determined by where you start, but by how well you navigate the journey&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'>

    <h2 id="speaking-from-experience"><strong>Speaking from Experience</strong>
</h2><p>Before diving in, I want to share a bit about my background: I was accepted into a <strong>top 30 US PhD program in physics</strong>, and I speak from <strong>personal experience</strong>. I have always been a bright student. My GPA in MSc was 3.6 and although I took PGRE and GRE, I didn&rsquo;t score stellar marks either. But I was significantly stronger when it comes to research experience. I had 3 first author publications and 2 other publications <strong>(some even in Q1 journals).</strong> I believe that it was my research merit that got me selected. I never wanted to apply to common universities because I knew for sure that, universities without serious research mean nothing for a career in physics except for a shaky promise to be able to stay abroad. So my priority was to apply to good research universities. But your priorities might be different. and I understand and respect that. The path to a career in physics is not easy, and coming from Nepal presents its own set of challenges. However, I firmly believe that success is <strong>not determined by where you start, but by how well you navigate the journey</strong>.</p>
<p>This article is <strong>not meant to intimidate</strong> but to offer <strong>clarity and encouragement</strong>. Many students in Nepal feel lost when it comes to making career decisions in physics, choosing electives, or deciding whether to pursue a thesis. My goal here is to <strong>debunk common myths</strong> and provide <strong>practical advice</strong> to MSc physics students who want to build a successful career in the field.</p>

<p>A successful PhD application depends on many factors, including the pool of applicants in a given year. If your PhD application is rejected from a university, it is not necessarily a reflection of your ability. Instead, it often means the university has <strong>limited PhD positions or a research focus that does not align with yours.</strong></p>
<p>It is crucial to select the <strong>Right-fit university</strong>. Some universities accept almost all applicants but do not provide funding. These institutions are engaging in academic fraud. If you can fund yourself or secure external scholarships like Fulbright, you can still consider these universities. However, a PhD is fundamentally a research degree, and without funding, it is not a viable option for most students. <strong>Therefore, only acceptances with funding should be considered successful PhD applications.</strong></p>
<h1 id="part-1-what-to-do-while-still-a-student"><strong>Part 1: What to Do While Still a Student</strong>
</h1><h2 id="the-reality-of-studying-physics"><strong>The Reality of Studying Physics</strong>
</h2><p>Who wouldn’t be excited to know that the universe is physically <strong>far bigger than we ever imagined</strong>? That there is a real possibility of <strong>extraterrestrial life</strong>? That <strong>the world we see is just a fraction of what’s out there</strong>? But beyond the awe and curiosity, there’s also the <strong>humbling realization of how much we don’t know</strong>.</p>
<p>Physics offers answers—<strong>real, testable answers</strong>—to the biggest questions we can ask. But pursuing physics as a career, especially from a developing country like Nepal, is challenging. The <strong>lack of information and guidance</strong> is one of the biggest obstacles students face. <strong>Information leads to knowledge, and knowledge grants the ability to make informed decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the good news: <strong>Physics is a universal field. Talent is not limited by geography.</strong> Students from countries with fewer resources have gone on to contribute significantly to science. Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka all have examples of physicists who thrived despite limited resources. Nepal is no exception. <strong>The real challenge is not a lack of opportunities but a lack of motivation and awareness.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-other-things-matter"><strong>What other things matter?</strong>
</h2><h3 id="alignment-of-your-thesis-topic-and-the-program-of-your-study"><strong>Alignment of your thesis topic and the program of your study.</strong>
</h3><p>I haven’t seen anyone talking about his but this is very crucial. If you are aspiring to do a PhD in Physics, now is the time to decide if you want to see yourself as a <strong>nuclear physicist, a particle physicist, a condensed matter physicist, a nano technologist, a bio-medical physicist, an astrophysicist, a cosmologist, a string theorist, or a fucking theoretical physicist.</strong> Decide it now while you are yet to start your third semester. I mean, its possible to take astrophysics as your elective subject and do a PhD in Bio-Medical Physics but why would you do that? You could have just done better by choosing Biomedical physics if you are to do PhD in Biomedical physics later on. Decide it now. If you are doing thesis, make sure that you do thesis on a topic that relates to Biomedical physics only. You have to be responsible for yourself. A supervisor is busy with his own life. Don’t take his decisions as to what should be your field of thesis. <strong>A supervisor can help you decide a topic but it is you and only you to decide which field should you be doing thesis on.</strong> Make sure it is going to be from the same field as your PhD program.</p>
<h3 id="your-personal-contact-with-the-professor"><strong>Your Personal contact with the professor.</strong>
</h3><p>In the previous section,  I said that your thesis topic should be from the same field you will be doing your PhD on. This is for a reason. <strong>When you have a research in the form of your thesis, you finally have something to brag about.</strong> Now choose a professor who is doing the same research and communicate. But keep in mind, ‘do not communicate for the sake of communicating’. If you have put a lot of effort in your thesis, you will have enough confidence to talk about it with anyone. Those professors have spent all their years and life thinking and doing that particular research. They can recognize your talent in an instant. Don’t expect them to be your God Father yet. <strong>If you are good enough, they will try their best to enroll you in their research group because they care for a great research team as much as you do for a great professor.</strong> They are also searching for bright young minds to whom they can leave their work to continue working after they are gone.</p>
<p>This way, you can establish good relationships with the professors at your home institution as well as at the new university where you would be applying.</p>

</h2><h3 id="myth-1-some-fields-are-better-than-others"><strong>Myth 1: Some Fields Are Better Than Others</strong>
</h3><p>When choosing a field in physics, it is important to understand the basis of comparison. If the question is, <strong>&ldquo;Is this field better than that one for getting a job?&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;Does Solid State Physics have more job opportunities than Cosmology?&rdquo;</strong>, then yes, some fields offer better career prospects.</p>
<p>However, the answer is not settled yet. Just because a field has better job prospects does not mean you will excel in it. It is always better to be highly skilled in a field you love rather than being just average in a field that does not interest you.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect field of study does not exist.</strong> Cosmology was at its peak in the 1960s and 70s, but that has changed. Astronomy saw a surge in interest during the 2000s, especially after the experimental detection of Hubble expansion in 1998. Now, only certain areas of observational astronomy, such as black hole observations, have significant scope.</p>
<p>The mystery of the origin of the universe is far from settled. Research related to astronomical probes for time scales beyond 10⁻⁴³ seconds holds immense potential. Similarly, the recent detection of gravitational waves has pushed observational astronomy into the spotlight. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), operational since 2021, will continue to provide insights for at least two more decades, creating opportunities in astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>However, times change. Twenty years ago, nanotechnology and biomedical physics were considered insignificant as career paths, but now they are booming fields. <strong>You are far more likely to find stable employment as a biomedical physicist than as an astrophysicist.</strong></p>
<p>In summary, a career in cosmology or astrophysics is extremely challenging abroad, whereas emerging fields like biomedical physics, nanotechnology, and quantum computing are growing rapidly. Choose wisely based on your interests and the evolving job market.</p>
<h3 id="myth-2-msc-thesis-work-is-too-difficult-and-time-consuming"><strong>Myth 2: MSc Thesis Work Is Too Difficult and Time-Consuming</strong>
</h3><p>A thesis is <strong>not supposed to be groundbreaking research</strong>. It is meant to <strong>train students in the research process</strong>. The difficulty depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topic complexity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your ability as a researcher</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time investment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing a topic that aligns with your PhD interest can also improve your graduate school applications. <strong>It’s not about difficulty; it’s about preparation and mindset.</strong> Anything that is different from the norm or some similarity and differences that you can show between things that aren’t discussed in your book, can be a topic of your thesis. Research is all about how you do it rather than what topic you choose.</p>
<h3 id="myth-3-msc-degrees-from-central-department-of-physics-are-superior"><strong>Myth 3: MSc Degrees from Central Department of Physics Are Superior</strong>
</h3><p>The program content is the <strong>same across universities</strong>. However, being in a dedicated physics department may provide <strong>more exposure to professors and research opportunities</strong>. <strong>The degree itself holds equal value.</strong> Its the same program under the same university.</p>
<h3 id="myth-4-no-labs--no-research"><strong>Myth 4: No Labs = No Research</strong>
</h3><p>Nepal’s MSc physics program focuses on <strong>theoretical high-energy physics</strong>. While experimental physics requires labs, <strong>theoretical research only requires good internet, a strong supervisor, and dedication.</strong></p>
<h3 id="myth-5-life-as-a-physicist-is-too-difficult"><strong>Myth 5: Life as a Physicist Is Too Difficult</strong>
</h3><p>Physics is <strong>challenging but fulfilling</strong>. You’ve already made it through demanding coursework. The excitement of <strong>learning about the universe</strong>, understanding <strong>how reality works</strong>, and contributing to human knowledge <strong>is worth the effort</strong>.</p>
<p>Physicists don’t pursue money or status—they pursue <strong>truth and discovery</strong>. If you are passionate about physics, <strong>embrace the journey</strong>.</p>

</h2><h3 id="myth-6-the-us-is-the-best-country-for-physics-studies"><strong>Myth 6: The US Is the Best Country for Physics Studies</strong>
</h3><p>The US is <strong>one of the best</strong>, but not necessarily the best for every student.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US, students <strong>go directly from undergraduate to PhD</strong> (5-6 years total).</li>
<li>In <strong>Europe</strong>, PhD programs are <strong>shorter</strong> (3-4 years), but highly competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Japan and Korea</strong> have excellent programs in <strong>plasma physics, nanotechnology, and biomedical physics</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many assume the US is best because of immigration policies. In reality, <strong>Europe offers shorter PhDs</strong>, and <strong>Japan/Korea provide growing research opportunities</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="myth-7-a-physics-phd-guarantees-an-easy-career"><strong>Myth 7: A Physics PhD Guarantees an Easy Career</strong>
</h3><p>A PhD in the US takes <strong>5-6 years</strong> on average. And that’s just the beginning.</p>
<p>In academia, a PhD graduate is still considered an <strong>early-career physicist</strong>. Postdocs, tenure tracks, and research positions are competitive. <strong>Knowing this in advance helps you prepare better and avoid frustration.</strong></p>

</h3><p>Visa approvals involve <strong>many unpredictable factors</strong>. While a strong GPA, GRE, TOEFL/IELTS scores improve chances, US visa interviews are **not purely merit-based **. Many students get rejected despite excellent credentials. <strong>Be prepared, but don’t assume it’s a guarantee.</strong></p>
<h3 id="myth-9-ictp-diploma-programs-are-only-for-toppers"><strong>Myth 9: ICTP Diploma Programs Are Only for Toppers</strong>
</h3><p>The <strong>ICTP diploma program</strong> in Italy is a <strong>one-year training program</strong> that helps students prepare for PhD admissions in top universities. <strong>You don’t need to be a topper</strong>—you need a <strong>strong GPA, recommendations, and motivation</strong>. If you are serious about your physics degree and your GPA is good enough, you should talk to your professor for the recommendation letter. You will be provided a monthly stipend of <strong>euro 800 +</strong> to afford for food and living expenses if you are selected for the program. After this training, your chances of being enrolled in a top-tier university for a PhD becomes exponentially high.</p>
<h3 id="myth-10-a-low-gpa-means-no-phd-opportunity"><strong>Myth 10: A Low GPA Means No PhD Opportunity</strong>
</h3><p>Even with a <strong>low GPA</strong>, strong GRE scores, research experience, and recommendation letters <strong>can compensate</strong>. <strong>Physics degrees are globally respected.</strong> If you’re committed, opportunities exist.</p>
<h3 id="myth-11-a-physics-gre-is-not-necessary"><strong>Myth 11: A Physics GRE is Not Necessary</strong>
</h3><p>Most top U.S. PhD programs no longer require the Physics GRE (PGRE). However, a strong PGRE score can still strengthen your application, particularly if you have weaknesses in other areas. For instance, if your GPA is low or if your university’s MSc degree isn’t widely recognized, a good PGRE score can provide additional proof of your academic preparedness.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about a career in physics, taking the PGRE is often a good idea. <strong>In some cases, a high PGRE score can even lead to a waiver for the qualifying exam, allowing you to transition into research more quickly after completing coursework.</strong></p>
<p>That said, if you’re applying to less research-intensive universities where the PGRE isn’t required, skipping it might be a reasonable choice. Ultimately, while the PGRE may not be strictly necessary, it can still be beneficial in many situations.</p>
<h3 id="myth-12-the-application-process-is-too-expensive"><strong>Myth 12: The Application Process Is Too Expensive</strong>
</h3><p>Applying to graduate programs can be costly, but careful planning can significantly reduce expenses. If you apply selectively to fewer universities, you’ll naturally save money. Additionally, some universities offer application fee waivers upon request—so it’s always worth asking.</p>
<p>As an international student, fulfilling the English language requirement is essential. Choosing the right test can make a difference. For U.S. applications, TOEFL is generally the best choice. <strong>However, if you’re applying to multiple countries, IELTS may be more versatile.</strong> Another cost-effective option is the Duolingo English Test, which is accepted by about 90% of U.S. universities. At around $65, it’s not only inexpensive but also delivers results quickly. Unlike TOEFL and IELTS, Duolingo allows you to send scores to universities for free, saving additional reporting costs and administrative hassle.</p>
<p>Visa-related expenses also add up. You’ll need to budget around <strong>NRs. 75,000</strong>—approximately <strong>NRs. 50,000</strong> for the SEVIS fee and <strong>NRs. 25,000</strong> for the visa interview appointment. However, by choosing Duolingo and applying strategically, it’s possible to complete the entire application process for under <strong>NRs. 100,000.</strong></p>
<p>That said, this decision impacts your life and career. If your ideal university requires certain fees, it might be worth the investment. Choose wisely.</p>
<h2 id="waiting-for-decisions-the-toughest-phase"><strong>Waiting for Decisions: The Toughest Phase</strong>
</h2><p>Decisions are finalized by April 15.
Acceptances begin as early as January or February.
If waitlisted, decisions may come by late March or early April.
<strong>Tip: Avoid overthinking.</strong> Keep exploring alternatives like research internships or additional coursework while waiting.</p>

<h2 id="physics-is-for-those-who-seek-answers"><strong>Physics Is for Those Who Seek Answers</strong>
</h2><p>If you love physics, don’t be discouraged by external challenges. The greatest minds in history—<strong>Einstein, Dirac, Heisenberg</strong>—faced their own struggles. <strong>If you are committed, there is a path forward.</strong></p>
<p>You are studying one of the most <strong>challenging and beautiful subjects in human history</strong>. <strong>Your work matters. Your curiosity matters.</strong> Keep pushing forward.</p>
